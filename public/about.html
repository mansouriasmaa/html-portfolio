<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Asmaa! I'm passionate about coding and love solving programming challenges. 
  I'm currently working on becoming a Python developer and I'm learning front-end development. 
  I also run a business specializing in high-quality abayas and khimars for Muslim women, 
  with a focus on delivering in Morocco and a dream of offering worldwide shipping. 
  I truly enjoy being a businesswoman and managing my own brand. In my free time, I enjoy discussing technology.
